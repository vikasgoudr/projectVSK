        <p>Ameenpur Lake is on the northwestern fringes of Hyderabad and is a man-made lake that was reportedly constructed more than 300 years ago during the reign of Ibrahim Qutb Shah (1550â€“1580 AD) by a courtier, Abdul Qadir Amin Khan of Patancheru, to irrigate his gardens. The garden no longer exists, but the lake has survived.[3] The lake is surrounded by undulating terrain with rocky outcrops and rocky formations which lie in the midst of an urban sprawl, surrounded by factories, villages, and modern apartments.[4]

Ameenpur once occupied an area of more than 300 acres (1.2 km2) but, due to encroachment, the lake currently covers an area of 93 acres (0.38 km2).[5]</p>
